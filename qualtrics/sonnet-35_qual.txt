Thank you for participating in this annotation task. We have provided 20 dialogues where an AI agent is responding to a user request, and we want you to evaluate the responses. This survey should take roughly 60-75 minutes. Progress will be saved automatically, so you can complete it in multiple sessions, but <strong>make sure you are using the same browser each time.</strong> Please rate individual dialogue responses of AI agents from 1 (worst) to 5 (best) on the following qualities: Conversation Consistency, Backend Knowledge Consistency, and Policy Compliance, the metric definitions are below. In addition, please rate the full dialogue in terms of task completion and response coherence. <br/><br/>

<strong>Conversation Consistency</strong><br/>
How much an agent's response align with the context of conversation context. </br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relevance</strong>: The response directly relates to the dialogue history and the current user query.</li>
<li> <strong>Topic Consistency</strong>: The response remains on-topic with the dialogue history and the user query.</li>
<li><strong>Coherence</strong>: The response logically continues the progression of the dialogue.</li>
</ul>
</br>

<strong>Scoring Scale</strong><br/>
<ol>
<li><strong>Very Good (5)</strong>: Response is completely consistent with the previous conversation context, with no inconsistencies or errors.</li>
<li><strong>Good (4)</strong>: Response is mostly consistent with the context. Only minor improvements are needed.</li>
<li><strong>Fair (3)</strong>: Response is somewhat consistent but contains noticeable inconsistencies or lacks depth in addressing the context.</li>
<li><strong>Bad (2)</strong>: Response shows limited consistency with the conversation context and requires significant improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Very Bad (1)</strong>: Response is incoherent or completely inconsistent with the conversation context.</li>
</ol>
</br></br>

<strong>Backend Knowledge Consistency</strong><br/>
How well an agent's response aligns with information provided by backend database results.</br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: The response directly reflects the information in the database results.</li>
<li> <strong>Topic Consistency</strong>: The response stays on-topic with the database results and the dialogue context.</li>
<li><strong>Coherence</strong>: The response logically incorporates and progresses based on the database results.</li>
</ul>
</br></br>

<strong>Scoring Scale</strong><br/>
<ol>
<li><strong>Very Good (5)</strong>: Response is completely consistent with the database results, with no inconsistencies or errors.</li>
<li><strong>Good (4)</strong>: Response is mostly consistent with the database results. Only minor improvements are needed.</li>
<li><strong>Fair (3)</strong>: Response is sufficiently consistent with the database results but contains noticeable inconsistencies or lacks depth in addressing the results.</li>
<li><strong>Bad (2)</strong>: Response shows limited consistency with the database results and requires significant improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Very Bad (1)</strong>: Response is incoherent or completely inconsistent with the database results.</li>
</ol>
</br></br>

<strong>Policy Compliance</strong><br/>
How well an agent's response adheres to the expected policy protocol. </br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Number of Suggestions</strong>: Providing suggestions only when the database results are small enough to do so.</li>
<li> <strong>Information Gathering</strong>: Requesting required, relevant information (slots) from the user before offering suggestions or booking services.</li>
<li><strong>Appropriate Timing</strong>: Avoiding premature actions, such as making a booking or suggesting a service too early in the conversation.</li>
<li><strong>Alignment with Policy</strong>: Avoiding actions that do not align with the suggested flow of interaction in the policy, when available.</li>

</ul>
</br>

<strong>Expected Policy</strong></br>
The chatbot response should depend on the database results and dialogue history: <br/>
<ul>
<li>If the database results return a number larger than 10: Indicate the number of entries that match the user's query and request additional information if needed to narrow down the results.</li>
<li>If the database results return values less than 10: If vital details are missing, request additional information. Otherwise, provide the relevant entries to the user</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>

<strong>Scoring Scale</strong><br/>
<ol>
<li><strong>Very Good</strong>: Response fully follows policy protocol with no errors or omissions.</li>
<li><strong>Good</strong>: Response mostly follows policy protocol, with only minor room for improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Fair</strong>: Response sufficiently follows policy protocol but has clear areas where it could improve in completeness or timing.</li>
<li><strong>Bad</strong>: Response does not adequately follow policy protocol, though there may be partial adherence.</li>
<li><strong>Very Bad</strong>: Response fails to follow policy protocol and is incomplete or incoherent.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Agent:</strong> I found 9 cheap guesthouses with free WiFi across Cambridge.

All have parking available. Would you like me to make a booking at any of these locations or would you like more specific information about any of them?<br/>

<strong>User:</strong> I'm looking for an expensive hotel with free wifi. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> I found 5 expensive hotels with WiFi.

Would you like more specific details about any of these hotels? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> Not really on the area. But I would like an expensive guesthouse. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> I apologize, but I couldn't find any expensive guesthouses with internet in our database. Would you like to consider an expensive hotel instead, or would you prefer to adjust your requirements, such as looking at moderate-priced guesthouses? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> Ok, well I guess a cheap one would work just as well. I need a place to stay. I would just still need free wifi. <br/>

<strong>Agent:</strong> Based on the available options, I'd recommend the Alexander Bed and Breakfast in the centre.

<strong>Agent:</strong> No, Alexander Bed and Breakfast is definitely a guesthouse, not a restaurant. It's what's commonly known as a B&B - a type of guesthouse that typically offers overnight accommodation and breakfast. It's one of the 9 cheap guesthouses with WiFi in our database. Would you like to hear about some of the other options, like Allenbell or Worth House, which are also 4-star guesthouses with similar amenities?<br/>

<hr>
<strong>User:</strong> I'm looking for an expensive hotel with free wifi. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> I found 5 expensive hotels with WiFi. Options include the University Arms Hotel (4 stars) and Gonville Hotel (3 stars) in the centre, Express by Holiday Inn (2 stars) in the east, Huntingdon Marriott (4 stars) in the west, and The Lensfield Hotel (3 stars) in the south. Would you like more specific details about any of these hotels? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> Not really on the area. But I would like an expensive guesthouse. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> I apologize, but I couldn't find any expensive guesthouses with internet in our database. Would you like to consider an expensive hotel instead, or would you prefer to adjust your requirements, such as looking at moderate-priced guesthouses? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> Ok, well I guess a cheap one would work just as well. I need a place to stay. I would just still need free wifi. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> I found 9 cheap guesthouses with free WiFi across Cambridge. Some options include: Alexander Bed and Breakfast (4 stars) and El Shaddai in the centre, Allenbell (4 stars) in the east, Finches Bed and Breakfast (4 stars) in the west, and Rosa's Bed and Breakfast (4 stars) in the south. All have parking available. Would you like me to make a booking at any of these locations or would you like more specific information about any of them? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> No I don't think so. Which one sounds the best? <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> Based on the available options, I'd recommend the Alexander Bed and Breakfast in the centre. It's a 4-star guesthouse with free WiFi and parking, located at 56 Saint Barnabas Road. It offers great value for money with its central location and high rating. Would you like me to make a booking for you there? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> Wait...is that a restaurant? I want a guesthouse. I'm so confused. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> No, Alexander Bed and Breakfast is definitely a guesthouse, not a restaurant. It's what's commonly known as a B&B - a type of guesthouse that typically offers overnight accommodation and breakfast. It's one of the 9 cheap guesthouses with WiFi in our database. Would you like to hear about some of the other options, like Allenbell or Worth House, which are also 4-star guesthouses with similar amenities? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> Oh, ok. Sure, go ahead and book 4 nights from Tuesday. There will be three of us. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> I'll book Alexander Bed and Breakfast for you - it's a 4-star guesthouse located at 56 Saint Barnabas Road in the centre. I've made a reservation for 3 people for 4 nights starting Tuesday. Your booking reference number is AB12CD34. The phone number is 01223525725 if you need to contact them directly. Can I help you with anything else? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> No. I need it for 4 nights. I try another time. Thanks. <br/>

All have parking available. Would you like me to make a booking at any of these locations or would you like more specific information about any of them? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> No I don't think so. Which one sounds the best? <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> Based on the available options, I'd recommend the Alexander Bed and Breakfast in the centre. It's a 4-star guesthouse with free WiFi and parking, located at 56 Saint Barnabas Road. It offers great value for money with its central location and high rating. Would you like me to make a booking for you there? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> Wait...is that a restaurant? I want a guesthouse. I'm so confused. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> No, Alexander Bed and Breakfast is definitely a guesthouse, not a restaurant. It's what's commonly known as a B&B - a type of guesthouse that typically offers overnight accommodation and breakfast. It's one of the 9 cheap guesthouses with WiFi in our database. Would you like to hear about some of the other options, like Allenbell or Worth House, which are also 4-star guesthouses with similar amenities? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> Oh, ok. Sure, go ahead and book 4 nights from Tuesday. There will be three of us. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> I'll book Alexander Bed and Breakfast for you - it's a 4-star guesthouse located at 56 Saint Barnabas Road in the centre. I've made a reservation for 3 people for 4 nights starting Tuesday. Your booking reference number is AB12CD34. The phone number is 01223525725 if you need to contact them directly. Can I help you with anything else? <br/>

I can see from our previous conversation that you were looking for a cheap guesthouse with WiFi for 3 people for 4 nights starting Tuesday.

<strong>User:</strong> I'm looking for an expensive hotel with free wifi. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> I found 5 expensive hotels with WiFi. Options include the University Arms Hotel (4 stars) and Gonville Hotel (3 stars) in the centre, Express by Holiday Inn (2 stars) in the east, Huntingdon Marriott (4 stars) in the west, and The Lensfield Hotel (3 stars) in the south. Would you like more specific details about any of these hotels? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> Not really on the area. But I would like an expensive guesthouse. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> I apologize, but I couldn't find any expensive guesthouses with internet in our database. Would you like to consider an expensive hotel instead, or would you prefer to adjust your requirements, such as looking at moderate-priced guesthouses? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> Ok, well I guess a cheap one would work just as well. I need a place to stay. I would just still need free wifi. <br/>

<strong>Agent:</strong>  I see you have three orders. Let me check each one to find your shoe order.
 I can see that you have a pending order (#W9911714) that includes Running Shoes, but since it's still pending, we would need to use the modify order function instead of exchange. For the other two orders that are processed, I don't see any shoes that have been delivered yet.

Could you please confirm:
1. Which order contains the shoes you want to exchange?
2. Have the shoes been delivered to you already?

This information will help me assist you properly with either a modification or an exchange.<br/>

<strong>Agent:</strong>  Let me help you find the specific order. You mentioned you want to exchange shoes for item ID 4107812777. First, let me check if this new item ID is a valid shoe product to exchange for.
 I can see that item ID 4107812777 is a Running Shoe in size 9, color black, with synthetic material and rubber sole. 

Looking at your orders, I can see you have a pair of Running Shoes (item ID 9791469541) in your pending order #W9911714. However, since this order is still pending and hasn't been delivered yet, we would need to modify the order rather than do an exchange.

Would you like to modify your pending order to change the shoes from yellow (current) to black? Or are you trying to exchange a different pair of shoes from a delivered order? If it's a different pair, please let me know the item ID of the shoes you want to exchange FROM.<br/>

<strong>Agent:</strong>  I see that both items are valid Mechanical Keyboard options. Let me summarize the changes you want to make to your pending order #W9911714:

1. Change Running Shoes from item ID 9791469541 (yellow, synthetic, size 9) to item ID 4107812777 (black, synthetic, size 9)
2. Change Mechanical Keyboard from item ID 1340995114 (tactile, no backlight, full size) to item ID 1421289881 (linear, no backlight, 80% size)

Since this is a pending order, we can modify both items at once, but we'll need a payment method to cover any price difference. Let me calculate the price difference:
 The total price difference will be $41.92 more than your original order. You have two payment methods available:
1. PayPal (paypal_3798357)
2. Gift Card (gift_card_4332117) with a balance of $86

Which payment method would you like to use for the price difference? Please confirm if you want to proceed with these changes and specify your preferred payment method.<br/>

<strong>Agent:</strong>  Of course, I can help locate your account using your name and zip code instead. Could you please provide your first and last name? Along with the zip code you provided (80280), I'll be able to authenticate your identity and assist with the exchange.

Please share your:
- First name
- Last name

Once I verify your identity, I can help locate your shoe order and process the exchange for you. <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  I'm Ethan Garcia. Could you find my order with that information? <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  I see you have three orders. Let me check each one to find your shoe order.
 I can see that you have a pending order (#W9911714) that includes Running Shoes, but since it's still pending, we would need to use the modify order function instead of exchange. For the other two orders that are processed, I don't see any shoes that have been delivered yet.

Could you please confirm:
1. Which order contains the shoes you want to exchange?
2. Have the shoes been delivered to you already?

This information will help me assist you properly with either a modification or an exchange. <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  I don't really remember the order IDs, just the item IDs I mentioned earlier. Can you figure it out? <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  Let me help you find the specific order. You mentioned you want to exchange shoes for item ID 4107812777. First, let me check if this new item ID is a valid shoe product to exchange for.
 I can see that item ID 4107812777 is a Running Shoe in size 9, color black, with synthetic material and rubber sole. 

Looking at your orders, I can see you have a pair of Running Shoes (item ID 9791469541) in your pending order #W9911714. However, since this order is still pending and hasn't been delivered yet, we would need to modify the order rather than do an exchange.

Would you like to modify your pending order to change the shoes from yellow (current) to black? Or are you trying to exchange a different pair of shoes from a delivered order? If it's a different pair, please let me know the item ID of the shoes you want to exchange FROM. <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  Yes, change the pending order to the new item ID 4107812777. Also, I think I changed my mind and want to swap product 1656367028 with 1421289881 too. Can you handle that for me? <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  I see that both items are valid Mechanical Keyboard options. Let me summarize the changes you want to make to your pending order #W9911714:

1. Change Running Shoes from item ID 9791469541 (yellow, synthetic, size 9) to item ID 4107812777 (black, synthetic, size 9)
2. Change Mechanical Keyboard from item ID 1340995114 (tactile, no backlight, full size) to item ID 1421289881 (linear, no backlight, 80% size)

Since this is a pending order, we can modify both items at once, but we'll need a payment method to cover any price difference. Let me calculate the price difference:
 The total price difference will be $41.92 more than your original order. You have two payment methods available:
1. PayPal (paypal_3798357)
2. Gift Card (gift_card_4332117) with a balance of $86

Which payment method would you like to use for the price difference? Please confirm if you want to proceed with these changes and specify your preferred payment method. <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  Use the gift card to cover any charges. What's my remaining balance after this? <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  I'll help you calculate the remaining gift card balance after this modification.
 After the modification, your gift card balance will be $44.08.

Let me proceed with modifying your pending order. Please confirm that you want to:
1. Change the Running Shoes from yellow to black (item ID 9791469541 → 4107812777)
2. Change the Mechanical Keyboard to the 80% size version (item ID 1340995114 → 1421289881)
3. Use your gift card (gift_card_4332117) to pay the price difference of $41.92

Please reply with "yes" to confirm these changes. <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  Yes, please go ahead with these changes. <br/>

<strong>Agent:</strong>  Thank you for confirming. I'll proceed with modifying your pending order now.
 Great! The modifications have been successfully completed:
1. Your Running Shoes have been changed to the black color version
2. Your Mechanical Keyboard has been changed to the 80% size version with linear switches
3. The price difference of $41.92 has been charged to your gift card
4. Your gift card now has a remaining balance of $44.08

The order status is now "pending (item modified)" and will continue processing. Is there anything else you need help with?<br/>

<strong>Database Result</strong>: Nothing Found <br/>

<hr>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  Yes, I can help you modify the payment method for your order since it's still in "pending" status. I see you want to change it from your Mastercard to your gift card which has a $60.00 balance. However, since your order total is $321.18 and your gift card balance is only $60.00, the gift card won't be able to cover the full amount. Would you like me to proceed with keeping the payment on your Mastercard, or would you prefer to explore other payment options?

If you'd like to use your gift card for a future purchase when you have a sufficient balance, you can certainly do that. Let me know what you'd prefer to do!<br/>

I see you want to change it from your Mastercard to your gift card which has a $60.00 balance. However, since your order total is $321.18 and your gift card balance is only $60.00, the gift card won't be able to cover the full amount. Would you like me to proceed with keeping the payment on your Mastercard, or would you prefer to explore other payment options?

If you'd like to use your gift card for a future purchase when you have a sufficient balance, you can certainly do that. Let me know what you'd prefer to do! <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  Hmm, is there a way to use the gift card balance and then cover the rest with another payment method? If so, I'd prefer to use my Visa for the remaining amount instead of the Mastercard. <br/>

<hr>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  I apologize, but our system can only use one payment method per order. You cannot split the payment between a gift card and a credit card for the same order. 

Your options are:
1. Keep the current payment method (Mastercard ending in 4336)
2. Switch entirely to your Visa (ending in 8902)
3. Save your $60 gift card balance for a future purchase that's $60 or less

<strong>Agent:</strong>  I'll help you change the cabin from business to economy class. Before I proceed, let me check for available flights on May 23rd to show you the options.
 I've found several options for your flight. The cheapest combination would be:
1. ATL to LGA: Flight HAT110 at 2:00 PM
2. LGA to PHL: Flight HAT206 at 6:00 PM

This would be available in basic economy for a total of $119 ($62 + $57).

Before I proceed with the change, please note:
1. Since this would be basic economy, the ticket cannot be modified after this change
2. As a gold member, you'll still be entitled to 2 free checked bags even in basic economy
3. You'll receive a refund for the price difference between your current business class ticket and the new basic economy ticket

Would you like me to proceed with changing your reservation to this basic economy option? Please confirm with "yes" if you'd like to proceed.

Also, since this will involve a refund, I'll need a payment method from your profile for processing. You have:
1. Certificate (certificate_7473723) with $150
2. Gift card (gift_card_8887175) with $35

Which payment method would you like to use for processing the refund?<br/>

<strong>User:</strong>  Hi, I'm looking to change a flight reservation. Could you assist me with that? <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  I'll help you modify your flight reservation. To get started, I'll need:

1. Your user ID
2. The reservation ID you'd like to modify

Could you please provide these details? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  Sure, my user ID is aarav_garcia_1177, but I don't have the reservation ID with me right now. Is it possible to proceed without it? <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  I can see you have two reservations: M05KNL and UHDAHF. Let me get the details for both so you can identify which one you'd like to modify.
 Here are your two reservations:

1. Reservation M05KNL:
   - One-way business class flight from ATL to PHL (via ORD) on May 23, 2024
   - 1 passenger (Aarav Garcia)

   - Outbound: May 19, 2024
   - Return: May 27-28, 2024
   - 1 passenger (Liam Rossi)

Which reservation would you like to modify? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  I'd like to modify reservation M05KNL, please. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  I'll help you modify reservation M05KNL. Since this is a business class reservation, you have several modification options:

1. Change the flights (keeping the same origin ATL and destination PHL)
2. Change the cabin class
3. Add checked baggage (you currently have 0 bags)

What type of modification would you like to make?

Note: Since this is a business class ticket, you're eligible for 3 free checked bags as a gold member if you'd like to add baggage. <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  I would like to change the flight to the cheapest economy option available, please. <br/>

<strong>User:</strong>  Hi! I want to book a flight from Chicago O'Hare (ORD) to Philadelphia (PHL) on May 26th. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  I'll help you book a flight from ORD to PHL. Before we proceed, I'll need your user ID to access your profile and check available flights. Could you please provide your user ID?

Also, I'll need to know:
1. Is this a one-way or round-trip flight?
2. Which cabin class would you prefer (basic economy, economy, or business)?
3. Who will be traveling (first name, last name, and date of birth for each passenger)?

Once you provide these details, I can search for available flights and help you with the booking. <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  Sure, my ID is sophia_silva_7557. I would like a one-way flight, please. I'm fine with economy class. There will be two passengers: myself, Sophia Silva, and an additional person, Kevin Smith, born April 12, 2001. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  I'll help you search for flights. First, let me check your profile and then search for available flights on May 26th.
 I found three direct flights available on May 26th, 2024:
1. HAT289: Departs 5:00 AM, arrives 7:00 AM - Economy price: $161
2. HAT139: Departs 5:00 PM, arrives 7:00 PM - Economy price: $114
3. HAT271: Departs 7:00 PM, arrives 9:00 PM - Economy price: $174

Which flight would you prefer? Also, before proceeding with the booking, I'll need a few more details:
1. How many checked bags would you like to add? As a regular member, you get 1 free checked bag per person in economy class.
2. Would you like to add travel insurance? It costs $30 per passenger and allows for full refund if you need to cancel due to health or weather reasons.
3. Which payment method would you like to use? You have the following options:
   - Credit Card ending in 7238
   - Gift Card with $274 balance
   - Two certificates ($500 and $150)

Please let me know your preferences, and I'll prepare the booking details for your confirmation. <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  I'll go with the HAT139 flight that departs at 5:00 PM. We won't be adding any checked bags, and we don't need travel insurance. Let's use the gift card with the $274 balance and the rest from the credit card ending in 7238 for payment. <br/>
