Agent: There are 9 cheap guesthouses with free wifi available, please choose one from the following options: Alexander Bed and Breakfast, Allenbell, Autumn House, City Centre North B and B, El Shaddai, Finches Bed and Breakfast, Leverton House, Rosa's Bed and Breakfast, or Worth House, or would you like me to provide more details to help you decide.

User:  Sure, it's aarav_garcia_1177. 

Agent:  You have two reservations, M05KNL and UHDAHF. Which one would you like to modify? 

User:  I'm sorry, I don't remember the reservation ID. Could you tell me which one is for the ATL to PHL trip? 

Agent:  I've found your ATL to PHL trip. It's a one-way business flight with a layover in ORD. How would you like to modify this reservation? 

User:  I'd like to change it to the cheapest economy flight available. Can you also adjust the date to be one day later than the original reservation? 

Agent:  I found a one-way economy flight from ATL to PHL on 2024-05-24 with a layover in ORD for $104 on flights HAT227 and HAT139. This would be a refund of $1706 from your original flight. Would you like to proceed with this change? 

User:  Yes, please proceed with the change. I'm happy with the refund.
