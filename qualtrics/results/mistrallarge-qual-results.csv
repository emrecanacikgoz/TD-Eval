User: I'm looking for an expensive hotel with free wifi. 

Agent: There are 5 expensive hotels with free wifi. Do you have a preferred area or any other specific requirements? Here are a couple of options: The Gonville Hotel in the centre and the Huntingdon Marriott Hotel in the west. 

User: Not really on the area. But I would like an expensive guesthouse. 

Agent: I'm sorry, but there are no expensive guesthouses with free wifi available. Would you like to consider hotels or adjust your preferences? 

User: Ok, well I guess a cheap one would work just as well. I need a place to stay. I would just still need free wifi. 

Agent: There are 9 cheap guesthouses with free wifi available. To help you find the best option, could you please specify the area you prefer or any other details like the number of stars? Here are a couple of options: Alexander Bed and Breakfast in the centre and Allenbell in the east.

Agent:  Sure, I can help with that. Could you please provide your email address for authentication?

Agent:  Isabella, your gift card has a balance of $60.
