User: Sure, my user ID is ivan_muller_7015. I'm looking to book the same flights that are in my current reservation for my friend.

Agent: To book the same flights for your friend, I'll need the following details:


	Passenger Information: First name, last name, and date of birth for each passenger (up to five passengers).
	Payment Method: You can use one travel certificate, one credit card, and up to three gift cards from your profile.
	Travel Insurance: Would you like to add travel insurance for $30 per passenger?


Please provide these details so we can proceed with the booking.


User: Sure, the passenger's name is Ivan Smith. His date of birth should be in my profile, but I don't remember it right now. For payment, I'd like to use my certificate first. I won't be needing travel insurance, thanks.

Agent: The total cost for the reservation is $375, and your travel certificate covers $299. There is a remaining balance of $76. Would you like to use your credit card ending in 6710 to cover this amount?

User: Yes, that sounds perfect using the credit card to cover the remaining balance. Could you also let me know what the remaining balance on the travel certificate will be after this booking?
