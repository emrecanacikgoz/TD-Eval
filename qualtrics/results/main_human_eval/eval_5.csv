User:  Thanks for that. Could you please cancel any reservations with flights over 3 hours? Let me know when that’s done. 

Agent: To proceed with canceling the reservations, I need to know the reason for cancellation for each reservation. The eligible reservations for cancellation based on your criteria are:

Reservation ID: S61CZX (Flights over 3 hours)

Please provide the reason for cancellation for each, such as ""change of plan,"" ""airline cancelled flight,"" or ""other reasons."" 

User:  Please use ""change of plan"" as the reason for both cancellations. 

Agent: Unfortunately, I can only cancel reservations within 24 hours of booking or if the airline canceled the flight. For basic economy or economy flights, cancellation is only possible if travel insurance was purchased and the condition is met, or if the flights are in business class.
Since the reservations you want to cancel are in basic economy and economy class, and the reason is ""change of plan,"" I won't be able to proceed with the cancellation. If you have any other requests or need further assistance, please let me know!

Please provide the reason for cancellation for each, such as ""change of plan,"" ""airline cancelled flight,"" or ""other reasons."" 

User:  Please use ""change of plan"" as the reason for both cancellations. 

Agent: Unfortunately, I can only cancel reservations within 24 hours of booking or if the airline canceled the flight. For basic economy or economy flights, cancellation is only possible if travel insurance was purchased and the condition is met, or if the flights are in business class.
Since the reservations you want to cancel are in basic economy and economy class, and the reason is ""change of plan,"" I won't be able to proceed with the cancellation. If you have any other requests or need further assistance, please let me know! 

User:  In that case, could you try upgrading the flights under 3 hours to business class, if possible? 

Agent: To upgrade the flights to business class, I will proceed with the following reservations that have flights under 3 hours:

Reservation ID: NM1VX1
Reservation ID: KC18K6

I will calculate the cost difference for upgrading these flights to business class. Please confirm if you would like to proceed with the upgrade, and I'll provide the details for your confirmation. 

User:  Yes, please go ahead and provide the details for upgrading those reservations. 

Agent: Here are the details for upgrading the reservations to business class:

Reservation ID: NM1VX1
