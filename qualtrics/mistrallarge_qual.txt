Thank you for participating in this annotation task. We have provided 20 dialogues where an AI agent is responding to a user request, and we want you to evaluate the responses. This survey should take roughly 60-75 minutes. Progress will be saved automatically, so you can complete it in multiple sessions, but <strong>make sure you are using the same browser each time.</strong> Please rate individual dialogue responses of AI agents from 1 (worst) to 5 (best) on the following qualities: Conversation Consistency, Backend Knowledge Consistency, and Policy Compliance, the metric definitions are below. In addition, please rate the full dialogue in terms of task completion and response coherence. <br/><br/>

<strong>Conversation Consistency</strong><br/>
How much an agent's response align with the context of conversation context. </br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relevance</strong>: The response directly relates to the dialogue history and the current user query.</li>
<li> <strong>Topic Consistency</strong>: The response remains on-topic with the dialogue history and the user query.</li>
<li><strong>Coherence</strong>: The response logically continues the progression of the dialogue.</li>
</ul>
</br>

<strong>Scoring Scale</strong><br/>
<ol>
<li><strong>Very Good (5)</strong>: Response is completely consistent with the previous conversation context, with no inconsistencies or errors.</li>
<li><strong>Good (4)</strong>: Response is mostly consistent with the context. Only minor improvements are needed.</li>
<li><strong>Fair (3)</strong>: Response is somewhat consistent but contains noticeable inconsistencies or lacks depth in addressing the context.</li>
<li><strong>Bad (2)</strong>: Response shows limited consistency with the conversation context and requires significant improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Very Bad (1)</strong>: Response is incoherent or completely inconsistent with the conversation context.</li>
</ol>
</br></br>

<strong>Backend Knowledge Consistency</strong><br/>
How well an agent's response aligns with information provided by backend database results.</br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: The response directly reflects the information in the database results.</li>
<li> <strong>Topic Consistency</strong>: The response stays on-topic with the database results and the dialogue context.</li>
<li><strong>Coherence</strong>: The response logically incorporates and progresses based on the database results.</li>
</ul>
</br></br>

<strong>Scoring Scale</strong><br/>
<ol>
<li><strong>Very Good (5)</strong>: Response is completely consistent with the database results, with no inconsistencies or errors.</li>
<li><strong>Good (4)</strong>: Response is mostly consistent with the database results. Only minor improvements are needed.</li>
<li><strong>Fair (3)</strong>: Response is sufficiently consistent with the database results but contains noticeable inconsistencies or lacks depth in addressing the results.</li>
<li><strong>Bad (2)</strong>: Response shows limited consistency with the database results and requires significant improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Very Bad (1)</strong>: Response is incoherent or completely inconsistent with the database results.</li>
</ol>
</br></br>

<strong>Policy Compliance</strong><br/>
How well an agent's response adheres to the expected policy protocol. </br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Number of Suggestions</strong>: Providing suggestions only when the database results are small enough to do so.</li>
<li> <strong>Information Gathering</strong>: Requesting required, relevant information (slots) from the user before offering suggestions or booking services.</li>
<li><strong>Appropriate Timing</strong>: Avoiding premature actions, such as making a booking or suggesting a service too early in the conversation.</li>
<li><strong>Alignment with Policy</strong>: Avoiding actions that do not align with the suggested flow of interaction in the policy, when available.</li>

</ul>
</br>

<strong>Expected Policy</strong></br>
The chatbot response should depend on the database results and dialogue history: <br/>
<ul>
<li>If the database results return a number larger than 10: Indicate the number of entries that match the user's query and request additional information if needed to narrow down the results.</li>
<li>If the database results return values less than 10: If vital details are missing, request additional information. Otherwise, provide the relevant entries to the user</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>

<strong>Scoring Scale</strong><br/>
<ol>
<li><strong>Very Good</strong>: Response fully follows policy protocol with no errors or omissions.</li>
<li><strong>Good</strong>: Response mostly follows policy protocol, with only minor room for improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Fair</strong>: Response sufficiently follows policy protocol but has clear areas where it could improve in completeness or timing.</li>
<li><strong>Bad</strong>: Response does not adequately follow policy protocol, though there may be partial adherence.</li>
<li><strong>Very Bad</strong>: Response fails to follow policy protocol and is incomplete or incoherent.</li>
</ol>

<strong>User:</strong> I'm looking for an expensive hotel with free wifi. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> There are 5 expensive hotels with free wifi. Do you have a preferred area or any other specific requirements? Here are a couple of options: The Gonville Hotel in the centre and the Huntingdon Marriott Hotel in the west. <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> Not really on the area. But I would like an expensive guesthouse. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> I'm sorry, but there are no expensive guesthouses with free wifi available. Would you like to consider hotels or adjust your preferences? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> Ok, well I guess a cheap one would work just as well. I need a place to stay. I would just still need free wifi. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> There are 9 cheap guesthouses with free wifi available. To help you find the best option, could you please specify the area you prefer or any other details like the number of stars? Here are a couple of options: Alexander Bed and Breakfast in the centre and Allenbell in the east. <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> No I don't think so. Which one sounds the best? <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> Both Alexander Bed and Breakfast and Allenbell are highly rated cheap guesthouses with free wifi. Alexander Bed and Breakfast is located in the centre at 56 Saint Barnabas Road, while Allenbell is in the east at 517A Coldham Lane. Which one would you prefer to book? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> Wait...is that a restaurant? I want a guesthouse. I'm so confused. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> Both Alexander Bed and Breakfast and Allenbell are indeed guesthouses. Alexander Bed and Breakfast is located in the centre at 56 Saint Barnabas Road, while Allenbell is in the east at 517A Coldham Lane. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> Oh, ok. Sure, go ahead and book 4 nights from Tuesday. There will be three of us. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> Your booking for 4 nights starting on Tuesday for 3 people at Alexander Bed and Breakfast has been confirmed. The reference number for your reservation is A1B2C3D4. <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> No. I need it for 4 nights. I try another time. Thanks. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> Your previous booking was canceled. There are 9 cheap guesthouses with free wifi available. Would you like to book "Alexander Bed and Breakfast" again or consider another option like "Allenbell" in the east or "Autumn House" also in the east? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> Could you look again for a place in the cheap range. Area does not matter. <br/>
