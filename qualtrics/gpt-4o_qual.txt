Thank you for participating in this annotation task. We have provided 20 dialogues where an AI agent is responding to a user request, and we want you to evaluate the responses. This survey should take roughly 60-75 minutes. Progress will be saved automatically, so you can complete it in multiple sessions, but <strong>make sure you are using the same browser each time.</strong> Please rate individual dialogue responses of AI agents from 1 (worst) to 5 (best) on the following qualities: Conversation Consistency, Backend Knowledge Consistency, and Policy Compliance, the metric definitions are below. In addition, please rate the full dialogue in terms of task completion and response coherence. <br/><br/>

<strong>Conversation Consistency</strong><br/>
How much an agent's response align with the context of conversation context. </br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relevance</strong>: The response directly relates to the dialogue history and the current user query.</li>
<li> <strong>Topic Consistency</strong>: The response remains on-topic with the dialogue history and the user query.</li>
<li><strong>Coherence</strong>: The response logically continues the progression of the dialogue.</li>
</ul>
</br>

<strong>Scoring Scale</strong><br/>
<ol>
<li><strong>Very Good (5)</strong>: Response is completely consistent with the previous conversation context, with no inconsistencies or errors.</li>
<li><strong>Good (4)</strong>: Response is mostly consistent with the context. Only minor improvements are needed.</li>
<li><strong>Fair (3)</strong>: Response is somewhat consistent but contains noticeable inconsistencies or lacks depth in addressing the context.</li>
<li><strong>Bad (2)</strong>: Response shows limited consistency with the conversation context and requires significant improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Very Bad (1)</strong>: Response is incoherent or completely inconsistent with the conversation context.</li>
</ol>
</br></br>

<strong>Backend Knowledge Consistency</strong><br/>
How well an agent's response aligns with information provided by backend database results.</br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: The response directly reflects the information in the database results.</li>
<li> <strong>Topic Consistency</strong>: The response stays on-topic with the database results and the dialogue context.</li>
<li><strong>Coherence</strong>: The response logically incorporates and progresses based on the database results.</li>
</ul>
</br></br>

<strong>Scoring Scale</strong><br/>
<ol>
<li><strong>Very Good (5)</strong>: Response is completely consistent with the database results, with no inconsistencies or errors.</li>
<li><strong>Good (4)</strong>: Response is mostly consistent with the database results. Only minor improvements are needed.</li>
<li><strong>Fair (3)</strong>: Response is sufficiently consistent with the database results but contains noticeable inconsistencies or lacks depth in addressing the results.</li>
<li><strong>Bad (2)</strong>: Response shows limited consistency with the database results and requires significant improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Very Bad (1)</strong>: Response is incoherent or completely inconsistent with the database results.</li>
</ol>
</br></br>

<strong>Policy Compliance</strong><br/>
How well an agent's response adheres to the expected policy protocol. </br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Number of Suggestions</strong>: Providing suggestions only when the database results are small enough to do so.</li>
<li> <strong>Information Gathering</strong>: Requesting required, relevant information (slots) from the user before offering suggestions or booking services.</li>
<li><strong>Appropriate Timing</strong>: Avoiding premature actions, such as making a booking or suggesting a service too early in the conversation.</li>
<li><strong>Alignment with Policy</strong>: Avoiding actions that do not align with the suggested flow of interaction in the policy, when available.</li>

</ul>
</br>

<strong>Expected Policy</strong></br>
The chatbot response should depend on the database results and dialogue history: <br/>
<ul>
<li>If the database results return a number larger than 10: Indicate the number of entries that match the user's query and request additional information if needed to narrow down the results.</li>
<li>If the database results return values less than 10: If vital details are missing, request additional information. Otherwise, provide the relevant entries to the user</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>

<strong>Scoring Scale</strong><br/>
<ol>
<li><strong>Very Good</strong>: Response fully follows policy protocol with no errors or omissions.</li>
<li><strong>Good</strong>: Response mostly follows policy protocol, with only minor room for improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Fair</strong>: Response sufficiently follows policy protocol but has clear areas where it could improve in completeness or timing.</li>
<li><strong>Bad</strong>: Response does not adequately follow policy protocol, though there may be partial adherence.</li>
<li><strong>Very Bad</strong>: Response fails to follow policy protocol and is incomplete or incoherent.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Agent:</strong> There are 9 cheap guesthouses available with free wifi. Here are a few options: Alexander Bed and Breakfast located at 56 Saint Barnabas Road with phone 01223525725 in the center, Allenbell at 517a Coldham Lane with phone 01223210353 in the east, and Autumn House at 710 Newmarket Road with phone 01223575122 in the east. Would you like more details or perhaps make a booking for any of these options? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> No I don't think so. Which one sounds the best? <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> All of the listed guesthouses have similar ratings, features, and a 4-star rating. Alexander Bed and Breakfast is centrally located which might be convenient. Alternatively, you could choose Allenbell or Autumn House, both located in the east with excellent service records. Would you like to book any of these options or get more information about a specific one? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> Wait...is that a restaurant? I want a guesthouse. I'm so confused. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> Autumn House is a cheap 4-star guesthouse located in the east with free wifi and parking, at 710 Newmarket Road. Would you like to make a reservation or need more information? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> Oh, ok. Sure, go ahead and book 4 nights from Tuesday. There will be three of us. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> Your reservation for Autumn House, a 4-star guesthouse with free wifi and parking at 710 Newmarket Road starting Tuesday for 4 nights for 3 people, is confirmed. Your reference code is Q4W8D7NH. <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> No. I need it for 4 nights. I try another time. Thanks. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> I apologize, but the system has already provided the reservation details for Autumn House, a 4-star guesthouse with free wifi and parking at 710 Newmarket Road. If your needs have changed or you require a correction in the booking, please let me know if you'd like to modify or cancel this reservation. <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> Could you look again for a place in the cheap range. Area does not matter. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> There is 1 cheap guesthouse available which is Autumn House, located in the east with free wifi and parking at 710 Newmarket Road. Would you like to proceed with booking this guesthouse, or need more information? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> You don't have a cheap guesthouse (any area) with free wifi, for tuesday, 4 nights, 3 people? Could you please check again? <br/>

<strong>Agent:</strong>  I'll look up your recent orders to find the details for the shoes you want to exchange. Please hold on for a moment.
 It seems that the order containing the shoes you want to exchange is #W9911714, and the shoes are "Running Shoes" with item ID 9791469541. The order status is "pending," which means it hasn't been delivered yet. Unfortunately, exchanges can only be processed for delivered orders.

Would you like to modify the pending order instead, or is there anything else I can assist you with?<br/>

<strong>Agent:</strong>  Of course! I can help you with exchanging your shoes. First, I need to authenticate your identity. Could you please provide your email address or your name and zip code? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  My name is Ethan Garcia, and I live in Denver, 80280. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  Thank you, Ethan. I have successfully authenticated your identity. Now, could you please provide the order ID for the shoes you want to exchange? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  I'm not sure about the order ID. Can you figure out the details for me? I just want to exchange them to 4107812777. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  I'll look up your recent orders to find the details for the shoes you want to exchange. Please hold on for a moment.
 It seems that the order containing the shoes you want to exchange is #W9911714, and the shoes are "Running Shoes" with item ID 9791469541. The order status is "pending," which means it hasn't been delivered yet. Unfortunately, exchanges can only be processed for delivered orders.

Would you like to modify the pending order instead, or is there anything else I can assist you with? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  In that case, I'd like to modify the order. Can you change product 1656367028 to 1421289881, please? <br/>

<strong>Agent:</strong>  I can help you with that. Let's first check the available options for the "Mechanical Keyboard" and find a suitable replacement. Please hold on for a moment.
 The "Mechanical Keyboard" has several available options. Since you mentioned the item ID 1421289881, which is available, we can proceed with that. Here are the details for the new item:

- **Switch Type:** Linear
- **Backlight:** None
- **Size:** 80%
- **Price:** $268.77

The original item had a price of $235.13, so there will be a price difference of $33.64. You can choose to pay this difference using your available payment methods.

Would you like to proceed with this modification using your PayPal account or your gift card balance? Please confirm if you have provided all items to be modified.<br/>

 It seems that the order containing the shoes you want to exchange is #W9911714, and the shoes are "Running Shoes" with item ID 9791469541. The order status is "pending," which means it hasn't been delivered yet. Unfortunately, exchanges can only be processed for delivered orders.

Would you like to modify the pending order instead, or is there anything else I can assist you with? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  In that case, I'd like to modify the order. Can you change product 1656367028 to 1421289881, please? <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  The product ID 1656367028 corresponds to a "Mechanical Keyboard." However, the product ID 1421289881 you provided does not match any product in our store. Could you please verify the product ID you want to change to, or let me know the product name so I can assist you further? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  I'm not sure about the specifics. Could you take a look at the options and do the swap for me? <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  I can help you with that. Let's first check the available options for the "Mechanical Keyboard" and find a suitable replacement. Please hold on for a moment.
 The "Mechanical Keyboard" has several available options. Since you mentioned the item ID 1421289881, which is available, we can proceed with that. Here are the details for the new item:

- **Switch Type:** Linear
- **Backlight:** None
- **Size:** 80%
- **Price:** $268.77

The original item had a price of $235.13, so there will be a price difference of $33.64. You can choose to pay this difference using your available payment methods.

Would you like to proceed with this modification using your PayPal account or your gift card balance? Please confirm if you have provided all items to be modified. <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  I'll use the gift card balance to cover any charges. Could you also check my gift card balance afterward? <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  To proceed with modifying the order, I'll change the "Mechanical Keyboard" to the new item with item ID 1421289881 and use your gift card balance to cover the price difference. Please confirm if you have provided all items to be modified. Once confirmed, I'll proceed with the modification and check your gift card balance afterward. <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  Yes, please proceed with the modification. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  The modification has been successfully completed. The "Mechanical Keyboard" in your order #W9911714 has been changed to the new item with item ID 1421289881. The price difference of $33.64 has been covered using your gift card balance.

Your current gift card balance is $52.36.

If there's anything else you need assistance with, feel free to let me know! <br/>

<strong>Agent:</strong>  The reservation "M05KNL" is for a one-way trip from Atlanta (ATL) to Philadelphia (PHL) on May 23, 2024. The reservation "UHDAHF" is for a round-trip from Charlotte (CLT) to Los Angeles (LAX) starting on May 19, 2024.

It seems like "M05KNL" is the reservation you want to change. Could you please confirm this? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  Yes, "M05KNL" is the one I want to change. I'd like to move it to the following day. <br/>
