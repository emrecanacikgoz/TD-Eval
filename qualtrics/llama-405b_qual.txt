Thank you for participating in this annotation task. We have provided 20 dialogues where an AI agent is responding to a user request, and we want you to evaluate the responses. This survey should take roughly 60-75 minutes. Progress will be saved automatically, so you can complete it in multiple sessions, but <strong>make sure you are using the same browser each time.</strong> Please rate individual dialogue responses of AI agents from 1 (worst) to 5 (best) on the following qualities: Conversation Consistency, Backend Knowledge Consistency, and Policy Compliance, the metric definitions are below. In addition, please rate the full dialogue in terms of task completion and response coherence. <br/><br/>

<strong>Conversation Consistency</strong><br/>
How much an agent's response align with the context of conversation context. </br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relevance</strong>: The response directly relates to the dialogue history and the current user query.</li>
<li> <strong>Topic Consistency</strong>: The response remains on-topic with the dialogue history and the user query.</li>
<li><strong>Coherence</strong>: The response logically continues the progression of the dialogue.</li>
</ul>
</br>

<strong>Scoring Scale</strong><br/>
<ol>
<li><strong>Very Good (5)</strong>: Response is completely consistent with the previous conversation context, with no inconsistencies or errors.</li>
<li><strong>Good (4)</strong>: Response is mostly consistent with the context. Only minor improvements are needed.</li>
<li><strong>Fair (3)</strong>: Response is somewhat consistent but contains noticeable inconsistencies or lacks depth in addressing the context.</li>
<li><strong>Bad (2)</strong>: Response shows limited consistency with the conversation context and requires significant improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Very Bad (1)</strong>: Response is incoherent or completely inconsistent with the conversation context.</li>
</ol>
</br></br>

<strong>Backend Knowledge Consistency</strong><br/>
How well an agent's response aligns with information provided by backend database results.</br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: The response directly reflects the information in the database results.</li>
<li> <strong>Topic Consistency</strong>: The response stays on-topic with the database results and the dialogue context.</li>
<li><strong>Coherence</strong>: The response logically incorporates and progresses based on the database results.</li>
</ul>
</br></br>

<strong>Scoring Scale</strong><br/>
<ol>
<li><strong>Very Good (5)</strong>: Response is completely consistent with the database results, with no inconsistencies or errors.</li>
<li><strong>Good (4)</strong>: Response is mostly consistent with the database results. Only minor improvements are needed.</li>
<li><strong>Fair (3)</strong>: Response is sufficiently consistent with the database results but contains noticeable inconsistencies or lacks depth in addressing the results.</li>
<li><strong>Bad (2)</strong>: Response shows limited consistency with the database results and requires significant improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Very Bad (1)</strong>: Response is incoherent or completely inconsistent with the database results.</li>
</ol>
</br></br>

<strong>Policy Compliance</strong><br/>
How well an agent's response adheres to the expected policy protocol. </br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Number of Suggestions</strong>: Providing suggestions only when the database results are small enough to do so.</li>
<li> <strong>Information Gathering</strong>: Requesting required, relevant information (slots) from the user before offering suggestions or booking services.</li>
<li><strong>Appropriate Timing</strong>: Avoiding premature actions, such as making a booking or suggesting a service too early in the conversation.</li>
<li><strong>Alignment with Policy</strong>: Avoiding actions that do not align with the suggested flow of interaction in the policy, when available.</li>

</ul>
</br>

<strong>Expected Policy</strong></br>
The chatbot response should depend on the database results and dialogue history: <br/>
<ul>
<li>If the database results return a number larger than 10: Indicate the number of entries that match the user's query and request additional information if needed to narrow down the results.</li>
<li>If the database results return values less than 10: If vital details are missing, request additional information. Otherwise, provide the relevant entries to the user</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>

<strong>Scoring Scale</strong><br/>
<ol>
<li><strong>Very Good</strong>: Response fully follows policy protocol with no errors or omissions.</li>
<li><strong>Good</strong>: Response mostly follows policy protocol, with only minor room for improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Fair</strong>: Response sufficiently follows policy protocol but has clear areas where it could improve in completeness or timing.</li>
<li><strong>Bad</strong>: Response does not adequately follow policy protocol, though there may be partial adherence.</li>
<li><strong>Very Bad</strong>: Response fails to follow policy protocol and is incomplete or incoherent.</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<strong>User:</strong> I'm looking for an expensive hotel with free wifi. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> There are 5 expensive hotels with free wifi, here are a few options: Express by Holiday Inn Cambridge, Gonville Hotel, Huntingdon Marriott Hotel, The Lensfield Hotel, University Arms Hotel, would you like to specify an area to narrow down the results? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> Not really on the area. But I would like an expensive guesthouse. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> Unfortunately, there are no expensive guesthouses with free wifi available, would you like to consider other options or modify your requirements? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> Ok, well I guess a cheap one would work just as well. I need a place to stay. I would just still need free wifi. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> There are 9 cheap guesthouses with free wifi, here are a few options: Alexander Bed and Breakfast, Allenbell, Autumn House, City Centre North B and B, El Shaddai, Finches Bed and Breakfast, Leverton House, Rosa's Bed and Breakfast, Worth House, would you like to specify an area or book one of these options? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> No I don't think so. Which one sounds the best? <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> Based on your requirements, I would recommend Leverton House, it has a 4-star rating and is located in the east area, would you like to book this option and I will provide you with a reference number? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> Wait...is that a restaurant? I want a guesthouse. I'm so confused. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> Don't worry, Leverton House is indeed a guesthouse, but if you're unsure, I can suggest other options, such as Autumn House, Finches Bed and Breakfast, or Worth House, would you like to book one of these options and I will provide you with a reference number? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> Oh, ok. Sure, go ahead and book 4 nights from Tuesday. There will be three of us. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> I have booked 4 nights at Autumn House starting from Tuesday for 3 people, your reference number is 8G7F4E2D. <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> No. I need it for 4 nights. I try another time. Thanks. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong> I have booked 4 nights at Autumn House starting from Tuesday for 3 people, your reference number is 8G7F4E2D. <br/>
<strong>User:</strong> Could you look again for a place in the cheap range. Area does not matter. <br/>

<strong>User:</strong>  Hi there! I'm looking to change my flight from Atlanta to Philadelphia. Could you assist me with that? <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  I'd be happy to help you change your flight. Can you please provide me with your user ID and the reservation ID of the flight you'd like to change? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  I don't have my reservation ID with me right now. My user ID is aarav_garcia_1177. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  You have two reservations, M05KNL and UHDAHF. Can you please tell me which one is the Atlanta to Philadelphia flight you'd like to change, or provide me with the travel dates so I can look it up for you? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  I'm not sure about the reservation ID, but the flight was booked for tomorrow. Can you help me find it? <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  I apologize, but I couldn't find a reservation for an Atlanta to Philadelphia flight for tomorrow associated with your user ID. If you have any more information or details, please let me know and I'll do my best to assist you. <br/>

<strong>Agent:</strong>  I've checked your profile and I still only see the two reservations we previously discussed. Have you made any recent bookings that might not be showing up in your profile? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  I booked it a while ago, so it should be there. Could it be under a different date like today or the next few days? <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  I apologize, but I couldn't find any reservations for a flight from Atlanta to Philadelphia in the next few days associated with your user ID. If you have any more information or details, please let me know and I'll do my best to assist you. <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  That’s strange. Let's work with the reservations you see then. Can you tell me which reservation is an ATL to PHL flight? <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  The reservation M05KNL is a one-way business flight from Atlanta (ATL) to Philadelphia (PHL), but it has a layover in Chicago (ORD) and is scheduled for May 23rd. <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  Perfect, that's the one. I'd like to change it to the cheapest economy flight option for the following day. <br/>
