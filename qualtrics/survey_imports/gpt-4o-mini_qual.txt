Thank you for participating in this annotation task. We have provided 20 dialogues where an AI agent is responding to a user request, and we want you to evaluate the responses. This survey should take roughly 60-75 minutes. Progress will be saved automatically, so you can complete it in multiple sessions, but <strong>make sure you are using the same browser each time.</strong> Please rate individual dialogue responses of AI agents from 1 (worst) to 5 (best) on the following qualities: Conversation Consistency, Backend Knowledge Consistency, and Policy Compliance, the metric definitions are below. In addition, please rate the full dialogue in terms of task completion and response coherence. <br/><br/>

<strong>Conversation Consistency</strong><br/>
How much an agent's response align with the context of conversation context. </br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relevance</strong>: The response directly relates to the dialogue history and the current user query.</li>
<li> <strong>Topic Consistency</strong>: The response remains on-topic with the dialogue history and the user query.</li>
<li><strong>Coherence</strong>: The response logically continues the progression of the dialogue.</li>
</ul>
</br>

<strong>Scoring Scale</strong><br/>
<ol>
<li><strong>Very Good (5)</strong>: Response is completely consistent with the previous conversation context, with no inconsistencies or errors.</li>
<li><strong>Good (4)</strong>: Response is mostly consistent with the context. Only minor improvements are needed.</li>
<li><strong>Fair (3)</strong>: Response is somewhat consistent but contains noticeable inconsistencies or lacks depth in addressing the context.</li>
<li><strong>Bad (2)</strong>: Response shows limited consistency with the conversation context and requires significant improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Very Bad (1)</strong>: Response is incoherent or completely inconsistent with the conversation context.</li>
</ol>
</br></br>

<strong>Backend Knowledge Consistency</strong><br/>
How well an agent's response aligns with information provided by backend database results.</br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: The response directly reflects the information in the database results.</li>
<li> <strong>Topic Consistency</strong>: The response stays on-topic with the database results and the dialogue context.</li>
<li><strong>Coherence</strong>: The response logically incorporates and progresses based on the database results.</li>
</ul>
</br></br>

<strong>Scoring Scale</strong><br/>
<ol>
<li><strong>Very Good (5)</strong>: Response is completely consistent with the database results, with no inconsistencies or errors.</li>
<li><strong>Good (4)</strong>: Response is mostly consistent with the database results. Only minor improvements are needed.</li>
<li><strong>Fair (3)</strong>: Response is sufficiently consistent with the database results but contains noticeable inconsistencies or lacks depth in addressing the results.</li>
<li><strong>Bad (2)</strong>: Response shows limited consistency with the database results and requires significant improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Very Bad (1)</strong>: Response is incoherent or completely inconsistent with the database results.</li>
</ol>
</br></br>

<strong>Policy Compliance</strong><br/>
How well an agent's response adheres to the expected policy protocol. </br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Number of Suggestions</strong>: Providing suggestions only when the database results are small enough to do so.</li>
<li> <strong>Information Gathering</strong>: Requesting required, relevant information (slots) from the user before offering suggestions or booking services.</li>
<li><strong>Appropriate Timing</strong>: Avoiding premature actions, such as making a booking or suggesting a service too early in the conversation.</li>
<li><strong>Alignment with Policy</strong>: Avoiding actions that do not align with the suggested flow of interaction in the policy, when available.</li>

</ul>
</br>

<strong>Expected Policy</strong></br>
The chatbot response should depend on the database results and dialogue history: <br/>
<ul>
<li>If the database results return a number larger than 10: Indicate the number of entries that match the user's query and request additional information if needed to narrow down the results.</li>
<li>If the database results return values less than 10: If vital details are missing, request additional information. Otherwise, provide the relevant entries to the user</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>

<strong>Scoring Scale</strong><br/>
<ol>
<li><strong>Very Good</strong>: Response fully follows policy protocol with no errors or omissions.</li>
<li><strong>Good</strong>: Response mostly follows policy protocol, with only minor room for improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Fair</strong>: Response sufficiently follows policy protocol but has clear areas where it could improve in completeness or timing.</li>
<li><strong>Bad</strong>: Response does not adequately follow policy protocol, though there may be partial adherence.</li>
<li><strong>Very Bad</strong>: Response fails to follow policy protocol and is incomplete or incoherent.</li>
</ol>

<strong>User:</strong>  Actually, I've had a change of heart. I also want to change product 1656367028 to 1421289881. Can you help with both? <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  To confirm, you would like to exchange the following items in your order **#W9911714**:

1. Exchange the running shoes (item ID **9791469541**) for a new item (please provide the new item ID).
2. Exchange the mechanical keyboard (item ID **1340995114**) for the new item with ID **1421289881**.

Please provide the new item ID for the running shoes, and I will proceed with the exchange. <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  Oh! I think the item ID you're looking for the shoes is 4107812777. Can you handle everything with these details? <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  Just to confirm, here are the details for the exchange:

- **Order ID:** #W9911714
- **Items to be exchanged:**
  1. Running shoes (item ID **9791469541**) for new item (item ID **4107812777**)
  2. Mechanical keyboard (item ID **1340995114**) for new item (item ID **1421289881**)

- **Payment method:** Please confirm which payment method you would like to use for any price difference (gift card or PayPal).

Please confirm that everything is correct and provide the payment method, and I will proceed with the exchange. <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  That looks right to me! Let's use the gift card for any price differences. Also, once everything is settled, could you tell me what my gift card balance would be? <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  It appears that the order **#W9911714** is currently in a pending status, and exchanges can only be made for delivered orders. 

Would you like to proceed with any other actions, or do you want to wait until the order is delivered to exchange the items? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  Oh, I guess I'll wait for it to be delivered then. Could you still check my gift card balance after all that? <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  Your current gift card balance is **$86.00**. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! <br/>

<strong>User:</strong>  Hi! I'd like to book the same flight I recently took on May 10 from ORD to PHL, but for May 26th. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  I can help you with that! First, I need to retrieve your user details to find your recent reservation. Could you please provide me with your user ID? <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  I think my user ID is sophia_silva_7557. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  I found available flights from ORD to PHL on May 26th. Here are the options:

1. **Flight HAT139**
   - Departure: 17:00 EST
   - Arrival: 19:00 EST
   - Price: $65 (Basic Economy)
   - Available Seats: 7

2. **Flight HAT271**

3. **Flight HAT289**

Please let me know which flight you would like to book, and I will need to confirm the passenger details and payment method. <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  Great! I'd like to go with Flight HAT139. Could you please add an extra passenger, Kevin Smith, with a birth date of April 12, 2001? Also, we would like aisle and middle seats together. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  I can only book a reservation for the same number of passengers as your previous booking, which was one passenger. Unfortunately, I cannot add an extra passenger to your reservation.

Would you like to proceed with booking Flight HAT139 for the existing passenger, Harper Kovacs? If so, please confirm the payment method you would like to use. <br/>
<strong>User:</strong>  I actually didn't mention Harper Kovacs earlier—there seems to be a mix-up with the names. I'd like to book for myself, Sophia Silva, and Kevin Smith. Is it possible to book it together as initially requested? If not, I'll need to know the total cost to decide. <br/>
<strong>Agent:</strong>  I apologize for the confusion. Unfortunately, I cannot modify the number of passengers in a reservation, and I can only book for the existing passenger details in your profile.

Since you want to book for yourself and Kevin Smith, I can proceed with a new reservation for both of you. Here are the details for the booking:
